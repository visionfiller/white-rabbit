What problem does your application solve?
My app will solve the issue of a user being unfamiliar with uncommon wines. For example, a customer is at a restaurant and doesnt see anything on the wine menu they recognize, they can use the app to plug in the wine, and receive information about that wine
How will your application work? Features?
It will be a multipage app. Where the main features are customer submissions, and the app compares that submission with the customer favorites to return a suggested wine. The employee side can modify and add objects to the wine library, which provides information on the wines

Why do you want to build this application?
Because i love wine, and learning about wine is a plethora of knowledge, and i want people to expand their horizons when it comes to wine and encourage people to venture out from just drinking chardonnay, sauv blanc, pinot noir, etc
Who are the target users of this application? 
Users that like wine, but are unfamiliar with the vastness of the wine world
